## Comparison: DIGITS vs General PC

| Feature                | DIGITS                                   | General PC                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | AI prototyping and deployment            | General-purpose tasks                |
| **Hardware**          | Blackwell GPU, 20-core Grace CPU         | Consumer GPUs (e.g., RTX 5070/5090)  |
| **Memory/Storage**    | 128GB LPDDR5X, 4TB NVMe                  | 8–32GB RAM, 1–2TB SSD                |
| **AI Performance**    | 1 Petaflop at FP4 precision              | Limited AI capability                |
| **Software**          | Pre-installed NVIDIA AI tools            | Manual installation required         |
| **Form Factor**       | Compact, Mac Mini-like                   | Larger desktop or less powerful laptop |
| **Cost**              | $3,000                                   | Varies, generally cheaper            |
